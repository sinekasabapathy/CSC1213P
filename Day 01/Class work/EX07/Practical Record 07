Practical Number:07

Problem Specification:Typecasting in Java Programming.

Implementation:
class EX07
{
	public static void main(String[]args)
	{
		char c1='g';
		System.out.println("The character is :"+c1);
		
		int int1=(int)c1;
		System.out.println("The character is : "+int1);

		double d1=10.09;
		System.out.println("The value is : "+d1);
		
		int int2=(int)d1;
		System.out.println("The value is : "+int2);
		
		double d2=int1;
		System.out.println("The value is : "+d2);
	}
}

Output:
The character is :g
The character is : 103
The value is : 10.09
The value is : 10
The value is : 103.0

Conclusion:We have understood the program in java to typecasting.
